Plugin implementing `Circuit Breaker` design pattern. Request maker will have 3 states:
`Closed` - all requests are passing to the next plugin allowing to create requests
`Open` - no requests are passing to next step, every request throws error from last 'real' request
`Half-Open` - only limited number of requests are allowed to actually executes, if these requests were successful
state changes to Closed, otherwise goes back to Open

```
options: 
    getKey {Function} [= () => ''] allow to divide requests to different instances of Circuit Breaker, by default only one Circuit Breaker instance is created
    failureTimeout {number} [=120000] time interval in which failed requests will considered to get state
    failureThreshold {number} [=50] percentage of failed requests inside `failureTimeout` interval, if that number is exceeded state changes to Open
    minimumFailureCount {number} [=5] number of minimum request which should be failed to consider stats from current time interval
    openTimeout {number} [=60000] time interval in which all requests will forcedly fail, after that timeout `halfOpenThreshold` number of requests will be executed as usual
    halfOpenThreshold {number} [=5] percentage of requests allowed to execute while state is Half-Open

metaInfo:
     open {boolean} - is current request was block by Circuit Breaker
     breaker {CircuitBreaker} - instance of current Circuit Breaker
```
